Same Prerequisits as mentioned in the introduction.

## Install ScaleUI token package:

Install the `@scaleaq/scaleui-core` and `@scaleaq/scaleui-tokens` package.

```bash
pnpm install @scaleaq/scaleui-tokens
```

## Using ScaleUI tokens

-   The token package exposes styles, themes and fonts made by the UX team.
    To import the tokens in your project, you can do the following:

### Using tokens in Angular

After installing then you can add the ScaleUI styles from the `@scaleaq/scaleui-tokens` library.

This can be done by adding the global styles to the `angular.json` file e.g.: `"@scaleaq/scaleui-tokens/tokens.css"`. The structure looks something like this: `projects -> <app name> -> architect -> build -> options -> styles`. (see example in the [scaleui-mono](https://github.com/scaleaq/scaleui-mono/blob/main/apps/angular-demo/angular.json) repository).

## Installation

To install ScaleUI, use the following command in your terminal:

### Angular:

The `@scaleaq/scaleui-wc-angular` package will be the main angular package in the future, but there has been some issues with different Angular versions lately, for now we recommend using the `@scaleaq/scaleui-core` package with Web Components Directly until this is resolved.

```bash
pnpm install @scaleaq/scaleui-core
```

Once installed you can define the Web Components to the custom elements registry by adding these lines to your `main.ts` file:

```ts
//main.ts
import { defineCustomElements } from "@scaleaq/scaleui-core/loader";

defineCustomElements();
```

## Using components

Now you should be able to us the components in the library by including them in the template directly.

```html
<sui-button variant="action" variant="solid">Hello</sui-button>
```

If you get the error message:

> [ERROR] NG8001: 'sui-button' is not a known element:
> demo-angular17:start:

> 1. If 'sui-button' is an Angular component, then verify that it is included in the '@Component.imports' of this component.
>    demo-angular17
> 2. If 'sui-button' is a Web Component then add 'CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA' to the '@Component.schemas' of this component to suppress this message.

This can be fixed by including the CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA from `@angular/core` either in the component.ts file where the component is used in the template, or in a top level component/module.

```ts
//*.component.ts*/
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from "@angular/core";

...

@Component({
...
schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]
...
})
```

> Keep in mind that using `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` opts out of a lot of useful Angular template checking features. [Read more here](https://manuel-rauber.com/2021/02/23/youre-using-custom_elements_schema-wrong/). When the `@scaleaq/scaleui-wc-angular` library is in place this wrapper layer will be done automatically from our side.

All properties can be viewed in the storybook documentation for each component.

You can read more about how to use a specific component under the 'components' chapter.

## Shorthand

```
# A shorthand to install both packages at the same time:
pnpm install @scaleaq/scaleui-{core,tokens}
```
